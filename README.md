# Scalar_field_simulation
A simulation of interacting scalar fields in 1+1 dimensions implemented in python.
This simulation was coded for a bacchelor's thesis "Untersuchung des Einfluss des Koordinatensystems in einer numerischen Simulation reeller Skalarfelder in Lichtkegel- und Raum-Zeit Koordinaten", which was written in German.
For accessibility the simulation was coded and annotated entirely in English.
